    <h1>Techno Therapy</h1>
    <p>I am an aspiring Computer Scientist. While studying Computer Science at my university,
      I have worked on some really awesome technical projects. From desktop games to web applications,
    database system to computer graphics, I have experienced it all! Following are a few to name: </p>

            <p class = project_name> CodHer </p>
            <p>I partcipated in She Innovates 2019 Hackathon where my team came up with CodHer(). CodHer() is a fun
            computer game designed specifically for young girls to get them interested in technology as a field.
            my team won the first prize for this project. We turned this into a business idea later on. You could
            visit the<a class = 'website' href='https://fatemaquaid987.wixsite.com/codher'>CodHer() website</a> to learn more about our idea.

              Crappy Birds in a fun, single-level game based on a frog who has to save himself from the crappy birds and make his way to
              the bee hive. This game is made in C++ and SDL 2.0. </p>
