            <p>I graduated recently from the University of Pittsburgh, with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science.
              I am an aspiring Software Engineer looking forward to kickstart my professional career. <br>Back in high school,
              some of my male friends were of the opinion that 'Tech' is not a woman's cup of tea! I knew they were wrong but arguing
              with them would be a total waste of time so I decided to do something else, something different! I decided to pursue Computer Science
              and get back at them with a living example of a woman in Tech. Yup that's me! Since that day,
              I have made computers my best friend and it is this friendship which led me to be
              in the top 1% students in my class. <br>I am a creative and an artistic person. I love to work on projects where I can
              play with colors, shapes and, graphics. I am also an effective communicator and a team player. I have successfully
              led several team projects throughout my academic career. I recently led a team of 4 individuals to win 1st prize in ‘She Innovates 2019’
              hackathon for creating a video game: “CodHer()” to educate and motivate young girls about technology. I have a record of consistently delivering
              quality work within the allotted deadline for various assignments and projects. I am passionate about creating a positive impact in human
              lives by developing break-through technology.</p>
