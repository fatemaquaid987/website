So far in my portfolio website, you can find a homescreen with a heading and some description of myself followed by a few buttons. Each of these buttons have a text which tells you where you will be redirected if you click on it. If you click 'Artsy Adventures', you will be redirected to a page containing a few of my art projects. Similarly, if you click 'Digital Dreams', you will be redirected to a page containing a few of my digital media projects. Clicking 'Technical Therapy' or 'Miscellaneous Memos' will lead you to a page with only a heading for now. 
So far the website is very basic and not so happening. I am working on its styling using multiple CSS files.
